These functions have powerful calculation properties by which inductive reasoning can be replaced by equational reasoning. This paper introduces a generalisation of catamorphisms, dubbed ``paramorphisms''. Paramorphisms correspond to a larger class of inductive definition patterns; in fact, we show that any function defined on an initial type can be expressed as a paramorphism. In spite of this generality, it turns out that paramorphisms have calculation properties very similar to those of catamorphisms. In particular, we prove a Unique Extension Property and a Promotion Theorem for paramorphisms.",
