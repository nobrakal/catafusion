%!TEX root = fusion.tex

There are several improvements that can be made:
\begin{itemize}
\item As mentioned by Peyton Jones et al. \cite{pbr}, forcing the inlining of functions be able to rewrite them can produce a lot of code. A possible solution is to introduce a rule per function that rewrite them back if fusion did not happen.
\item As explained, fusion of paramorphisms is not always a good idea. It would be pleasing to have a convenient type criterion that makes the fusion interesting.
\end{itemize}
